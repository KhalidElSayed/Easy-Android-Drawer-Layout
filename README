Easy Android Drawer Layout
---------------------------
(Created by Juan Carlos Ospina Gonzalez/piterwilson@piterwilson.com)

This Eclipse Android project is intended as a design exercise and created to provide a dead simple implementation that would replicate the 'Drawer Layout navigation' seen in popular apps like Facebook etcâ€¦


DISCLAIMER
----------

This example can probably be bettered. If you can and want, contact me.

WHY?
----

Being relatively new to Android, i was surprised at how complex this implementation can get with other solutions.

Additionally, Google's official solution does not have the exact behaviour i was looking for, which is that the whole content would move to the side when the menu was revealed (The menu part would overlay over the main content using Google's DrawerLayout).

Enjoy!
